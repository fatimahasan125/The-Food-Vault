# The-Food-Vault
Front end of a food ordering service

We have designed the front end of a food ordering service similar to FoodPanda. 

## Users and Roles
1. Customers: These are the users who are looking to place an order. They can view the entire list of restaurants, choose the items they want and place the order. They can also post reviews of the restaurants they have tried. 
2. Restaurant Managers: Each restaurant that partners with The Food Vault hasan associated restaurant manager who is responsible for updating the menu and accepting each order when it is placed. 
3. Admin: These are the users who are responsible for maintaining the list of restaurants that customers can view and place orders from. They can add/remove restaurants based on their agreement.
